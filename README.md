#  Insta-Bot-1: Instagram Automation with Selenium
 
 Insta-Bot-1 is an Instagram automation bot designed using Selenium to automate tasks like liking posts, following users, and commenting on posts on Instagram. The bot interacts with Instagram’s web interface in a manner similar to a human user, performing repetitive actions to increase engagement or manage a social media account efficiently.

Key features:

1. Automated Login: Automates logging into Instagram with user credentials securely.
2. Post Liking: Automatically likes posts based on specific hashtags or user profiles.
3. Commenting: Automates posting pre-defined or random comments on posts to increase visibility.
4. Following/Unfollowing Users: Allows automated following and unfollowing of users based on specific criteria such as hashtags or user engagement.
5. Web Scraping: Extracts data such as posts, follower lists, and more using Selenium’s web scraping capabilities.
6. Error Handling & Delays: Implements random delays between actions to mimic human behavior, avoiding account suspension.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Selenium (for web automation and interaction)
- ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver (for browser automation)
- BeautifulSoup (optional for additional scraping tasks)
- JSON/CSV (for storing user data and activity logs)
